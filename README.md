# tot_init

## a custom setup to quickly get my settings right for new projects

I was getting tired of manually setting up my projects with eslint rules etc

so I figured I would automate it a bit

---

## How to use:

download or clone the repo,and move it into the location where you want to initiate a new project

using `npm`:

```zsh
npm i tot_init -g

npm exec tot_init name
```

replace "name" with your preferred project name
