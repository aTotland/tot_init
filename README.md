# tot_init

### a personal init setup

I was getting tired of manually setting up my projects with eslint rules etc

so I figured I would automate it a bit

also testing use of Bun vs Node/NPM

---

### How to use:

download or clone the repo, then move it into the location where you want to initiate a new project

assuming you have `Node` installed:

```zsh
node init.js "name" "mode"
```

or assuming you have `Bun` installed:

```zsh
bun init.js "name" "mode"
```

replace "name" with your preferred project name

replace "mode" with either `"npm"` or `"bun"`
