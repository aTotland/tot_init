# tot_init

## quickly get my settings right for my projects

I was getting tired of manually setting up my projects with eslint rules etc

so I figured I would automate it a bit

---

## How to use:

`cd` into your project `root dir` and run:

```zsh
npm i --save-dev tot_init
```

then run:

```zsh
npx tot_init
```

<!-- begin auto-generated rules list -->

<!-- end auto-generated rules list -->
