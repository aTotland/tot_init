# tot_init

## Simplifying Project Setup

Setting up projects can be a tedious task, involving manual configuration of eslint rules and installation of commonly used dependencies... etc

To streamline this process, I created _`tot_init`_ - a tool that automates project setup.

With _`tot_init`_, you can quickly and effortlessly configure your project, eliminating the need for manual configuration, making project setup a breeze.
